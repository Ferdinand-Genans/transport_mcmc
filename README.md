# Transport map MCMC project

This is the website version of the projected I created for the Master 2 course "Simulation Methods for Generative Models" at Sorbonne University.
The article studied for this project is "[Transport map accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5492)" by Matthew Parno, Youssef Marzouk.
The project involved an introduction to the concept of transport maps, a comprehensive study of the articl studiede, and implementation of its algorithm. The implemented algorithm was then compared with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

You can view the project [here](https://ferdinand-genans.github.io/transport_mcmc/transport_mcmc.html).

A pdf version is also available [here](https://github.com/Ferdinand-Genans/transport_mcmc/blob/master/Transport_MCMC_pdf.pdf).
